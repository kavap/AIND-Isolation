* Board symmetry
		- Build equivalent moves mapping using board symmetry
		- Remember equivalent boards, moves tables and solved boards in hash tables
		- Before expanding and tree, lookup in hash table if equivalent tree was solved (lookup based on equivalent moves mapping)
		- Use Board symmetry up to 3 level deep (after that it doesnt provide much advantage)
* Evaluation functions are very important
	- e.g. an evaluation function that detects partitions
* Develop and use opening book of plays
	- player 2 usually wins so try to be player 2
	- If I am player 1
		- Occupy center cell as first move
		- Then play reflection of player 2's moves in my subsequent moves
	- If I am player 2 and player 1 has taken center and is going to move to reflect my moves
		- go to a position where player 1 can't reflect my moves (find out 8 moves that have no reflections)
	- If I am player 2 and player 1 hasn't taken center square
		- take center square
