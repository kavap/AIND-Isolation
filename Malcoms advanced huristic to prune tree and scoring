* Board symmetry
		- Build eqivaluent moves mapping
		- Remember solved boards in hash tables
		- Before expanding, lookup in hash table if equivalent tree was solved (lookup based on equivalent moves mapping)
		- Use Board symmetry upto 3 level deep (after that it doesnt provide much advantage)
* Evaluation function
	- Partitions detection	
* Opening book
	- player 2 usually wins
	- If I am player 1
		- Take center if I am player 1
		- Then play reflection of player 2 moves in subsequent moves
	- If I am player 2 and player 1 has taken center and is going to move to reflect my moves
		- goto a position where player 1 can't reflect my moves
	- If I am player 2 and player 1 hasn't taken center square
		- take center square
